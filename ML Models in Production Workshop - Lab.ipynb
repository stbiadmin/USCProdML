    "### What are we doing here?\n",
    "\n",
    "You are in school because you either love to, or want to, work with data (hopefully both!). Over the last 10 years, the field of Data Science has matured quite a bit, and with it, the re-emergence of ML as a tool for solving some of the most challenging data problems with increased speed, accurracy and with entirely new capabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, Abbass and your other professors are teaching you all about how to make those amazing tools do amazing things--Right? Great.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, at some point you'll graduate (seriously).  You'll also get a job (seriously). At that job, you'll do some amazing work eventually--you'll build a ML model that passes all of the tests, and you'll probably want to scale it to your whole user populaton.\n",
    "\n",
    "So...What do you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where this workshop comes in.  There are a lot of ways to deploy and scale ML applications today (this is both a good and bad thing) but since it's all changing at breakneck pace, maybe school hasn't caught up yet.  So I want to show you a bit about the deployment paradigms that exist and give you a taste for where you might want to invest more time as you continue your ML/DS/AI Journey.\n",

The aim of this report is to predict the house sales in King County, Washington State, USA using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The dataset consisted of historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015. We will predict the sales of houses in King County with an accuracy of at least 75-80% and understand which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.”\n",

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. **This data was published/released under CC0**: Public Domain. Unfortunately, the user has not indicated the source of the data. Please find the citation and database description in the Glossary and Bibliography. The dataset consisted of 21 variables and 21613 observations."
